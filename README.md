Sin Nomine
==========

Sin Nomine is a hobbyist exercise in C programming. It started as an exercise
in curses programming and might slowly evolve into a roguelike game.

The provided `BSDmakefile` makes heavy use of the FreeBSD build system and will
not work on other platforms. For non-FreeBSD systems, a basic `GNUmakefile` is
provided, that you can use with GNU make to build the binary.

Currently it looks like this:
